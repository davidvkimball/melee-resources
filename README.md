# Blippi.gg
Hey everyone! I created blippi.gg so anyone that wanted to get into the video game Super Smash Bros. Melee could as quickly and as easily as possible. The Melee community is characterized by our vivacious enthusiasm and deep love for the game. During quarantine, we can't meet in-person to do tournaments, so we've turned to stay-at-home solutions to compete. 

A treasure trove of open source software has been made all for the love of this game - Slippi, a fork of the Dolphin Emulator, has been fine-tuned to recreate the console Melee experience with rollback netcode and includes match replay-saving features. Creator Fizzi quit his job and worked on this for 6 months before releasing it. Slippi is single-highhandedly keeping our competitive scene thriving. Supporting software like Clippi and Slippi Stats help us get the most out of our most hype matches. M'Overlay is software to display controller input and also control music playback for Slippi. And the Melee Stream Tool lets anyone who wants to stream Melee quickly and easily generate an overlay that can be updated dynamically and display information beautifully. 

Blippi aims to bring all of this amazing software into one place. And as a bonus, resources for newcomers who are interested in getting involved, a list of codes to add cool features to the game, an app to show you're playing Melee on Discord and Steam, and also a full tutorial on how to rip your copy of the game as an ISO. I'm planning on adding even more to this soon! 

While Nintendo might not always be the most supportive of our grassroots community, we've taken the charge ourselves.
